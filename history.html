            <h2>WHERE THE IDEA CAME FROM?</h2>
            <p>It started when we joined a video game competion that took place from 7.May to 15.May. The assignment was a "World turned upside down." and the idea of the game was here.</p>
            <p>After some time struggles, because it was during the week when we all had a school, we managed to finish the game and even won the competion.</p>

            <h2>WHERE WE ARE NOW</h2>
            <p>After the competion we leaved the game alone and had some break. After one year no new competion was in sight and we wanted to create a game. So we decided to make a full valuable game and rather then starting from a scratch, we decided to make the game from what we had from the competion.</p>
            <p>We started on 2. of December 2022 with one new member joining in and one more on the spring. We have no date of release and still a lot of work to do, but we want to finish the game no matter how much time it takes.</p>
